I remember
Leaves were fallin' down
In St. Germain
It was a cold November
You went away
An' i got a dream
Nobody knows who i am
Maybe you would understand
Anybody knows what i am
Down in a secret land
Nobody knows how i try
Not to tell another lie
Anybody knows in the end
I'll find a secret land
I need you
I feel you
I can't life without you
So long
I know that
We parted
I'll stay in this town
Cause i miss you so
I feel it
I mean it
The secret that
I'm gonna show
An' i turn back
I see that
All my love had to fail
But i miss you so
Nobody knows who i am
Maybe you would understand
Anybody knows what i am
Down in a secret land
Nobody knows how i try
Not to tell another lie
Anybody knows in the end
I'll find a secret land
