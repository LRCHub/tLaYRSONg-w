Push it along
Work work work to make it work
Push it along
Work work work to make it work
Push it along
Work work work if you want to improve it
Push it along

It's all there for you to feel it
Help your self to one that you can't deal with
Ain't no way that you could steal it
You misunderstand if you get greedy
Ah push

Work work work to make it work push it along
Work work work to make it work
Push it along

Don't confine your dreams to bed
You'll get scared if you get lazy
If you can't take enough to satisfy yourself
Then you'll go crazy

Wont do no good thinking
You got to do it
So it don't come easy the first time
Practice makes perfect, you know that I'll try hard
Use it or lose it
You got to put your heart and soul into it
Yeaheheh

You just need a push to make a start
If you don't succeed the first time

Use it or lose it
You got to put your back into it
