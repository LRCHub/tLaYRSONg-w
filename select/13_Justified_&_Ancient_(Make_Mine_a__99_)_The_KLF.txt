Justified & Ancient
All bound for mu mu land
Hey hey

They are justified and they are ancient
And they like to room the land
- Just roll it from the top -
They are justified and they are ancient
I hope you understand
- To theto theto thenow -
They didn't want to upset the applecar
They don't want to cause any harm
But if you don't like what's they're going to do
You'd better not stop them 'cos they're coming through

Bring the beat back

All bound for mu mu land
Hey hey

They are justified and they are ancient
And they drive an ice cream van
- Just roll it from the top -
They are justified and they are ancient
With still no master plan
- To theto theto thenow -
The last train left an hour ago
They were singing "all aboard"
All bound for mu mu land
Then someone started screaming
"Turn up the strobe"

Bring the beat back All bound for mu mu land
Hey hey Rocking to the rhythm in the ice cream van
With the plan and the key to enter in to mu mu
Vibes from the tribes of the jams
I know where the p.d's at
'Cos i know what time it is
Threes on the dial
Make mine a 99
New style, meanwhile

Fishing in the rivers of life (hoi!)
Vuga vulez, saga shan isa go
